# The Hitchhiker's Guide to 2CS501 (Machine Learning)

*This course was taught earlier under CE623 and shares/shared significant part of it's syllabus with 2IT422 - Data Engineering, 2CE423 - Data Warehousing and Mining, CE633 & 2CSDE71 - Data Mining. With this repository I aim to create a guide to acing 2CS501 and its analogs*
